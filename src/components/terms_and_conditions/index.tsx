                    You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorized users. You may not allow others to use your account.

                    You can register by creating an account on the DELTATRAINER Site, as further described in our Terms of Service. All information that you provide must be accurate, including your name, address, credit, debit or charge card numbers and expiration dates, and any other payment information. You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date and must provide changes promptly to <a href="mailto:matt@deltatrainer.fit" className="underlined-link" style={{color: "#fff"}}>matt@deltatrainer.fit</a>. DELTATRAINER’s use of your information is governed by our Privacy Policy.

                    When you first sign up for a Subscription you may be required to agree to a specific price and plan, which may include a commitment period term of one or more years (“Commitment Period”). We encourage you to maintain your Subscription for the applicable Commitment Period. The price available with your plan is valid until the Commitment Period expires, at which time your Subscription will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis at the then-existing non-promotional price for your Subscription level.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    DELTATRAINER may offer additional promotions or discounts related to Subscriptions from time to time. Please read the details of those offers carefully, as any additional terms presented to you during the sign-up process will form part of these Purchase and Subscription Terms. Unless specified in writing, all discount offers that require a payment are non-refundable, and all free months offered are in addition to the Commitment Period. Any free trial or other promotion must be used within the specified time frame of the trial or promotion. You may be required to have a valid payment method on file in order to initiate a free trial; if you do not cancel before your free trial period ends, your account will be converted to a paid Subscription and will be charged in accordance with these Purchase and Subscription Terms.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Membership Structure and Fees<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Your DELTATRAINER Subscription recurs on a monthly basis at the then-current rate until cancelled in accordance with the terms below. Billing occurs at the beginning of the Subscription cycle and provides unlimited access for one month thereafter. If the amount to be charged varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in sales tax), we will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. To change or terminate your Subscription, contact Member Support at <a href="mailto:matt@deltatrainer.fit" className="underlined-link" style={{color: "#fff"}}>matt@deltatrainer.fit</a>. If you terminate your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of the then-current term and your Subscription will not be renewed after the then-current term expires. For more information on cancelling your Subscription, please read the following section.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Suspension/Termination by DELTATRAINER.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    DELTATRAINER may immediately terminate or suspend your account, and all or a portion of your Subscription, without notice if: (a) your payment is more than 15 days overdue; (b) you provide false or inaccurate information; (c) you violate these Purchase and Subscription Terms, the Terms of Service or any other DELTATRAINER rules or agreements then in effect; (d) you engage in conduct that is a violation of any applicable law or tariff (including, without limitation, copyright and intellectual property laws); or (e) if you engage in conduct that is threatening, abusive or harassing to DELTATRAINER employees, agents, or other DELTATRAINER users, including, for example, making threats to physically harm or damage property.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    If we terminate or suspend your Subscription, your license to use any software or content provided in connection with the Subscription is also terminated or suspended (as applicable). If your Subscription is terminated, DELTATRAINER has the right to immediately delete all data, files, and other information stored in or for your account without further notice to you. You must pay all charges through the date of termination. Should you wish to resume your Subscription after any suspension, a restoration of service fee may apply. This fee is in addition to all past due unpaid charges and other fees.<br></br><br></br>

You agree to make payment using the payment method you provide when you set up your account. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our payment processor or financing partner to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Bill Inquiries and Refunds<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    If you believe you have been billed in error for a Subscription, please notify us within 60 days of the billing date by emailing <a href="mailto:matt@deltatrainer.fit" className="underlined-link" style={{color: "#fff"}}>matt@deltatrainer.fit</a>.

Unfortunately, availability of products cannot be guaranteed. Unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase, you must pay for products when you place the order. All products ordered will be delivered to the U.S. shipping address you provide. We reserve the right to cancel an order placed by you at any time and for any lawful reason prior to our delivery of the product(s) and receipt of payment in full from you, provided that we will refund any fees that you prepaid for those products. We may send an acknowledgment of receipt of your order to the email address you provide and/or proof of purchase information through the DELTATRAINER Site or to your email address after your payment has been processed.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Term and Termination; Account Deletion<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    This Agreement begins on the date you first use the DELTATRAINER Service and continues as long as you have an account with us and/or continue to use the DELTATRAINER Service.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    DELTATRAINER may, in DELTATRAINER’s sole discretion, suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any User Content (defined below) that you submitted if DELTATRAINER determines that you have violated this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage DELTATRAINER’s reputation and goodwill. If DELTATRAINER deletes your account for these reasons, you may not re-register for or use the DELTATRAINER Service under any other user name or profile. DELTATRAINER may block your access to the DELTATRAINER Service to prevent re-⁠registration.<br></br><br></br>
                    
                    
                    Upon termination of this Agreement all licenses granted by DELTATRAINER will terminate. The following sections survive termination: Submissions, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Professional Advice Disclaimer, Medical Disclaimer, Intellectual Property and all General Provisions. In the event of account deletion for any reason, User Content may no longer be available and DELTATRAINER is not responsible for the deletion or loss of such User Content. For clarity, if you cancel your Subscription or it is terminated for any reason, you will lose access to the DELTATRAINER app and any other content or features provided through the DELTATRAINER Service. DELTATRAINER, in its sole discretion, may make available a very limited amount of content or features to non-subscribers from time to time.<br></br><br></br>
